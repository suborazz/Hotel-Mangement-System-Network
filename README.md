# Hotel Management System Network Simulation

## Overview

This project is a network simulation of a Hotel Management System, designed and implemented using Cisco Packet Tracer. The network architecture aims to provide a robust and efficient communication infrastructure for various hotel operations. It demonstrates key networking concepts and practical skills in network design and configuration.

## Network Design

The network features a hierarchical design with the following layers:

* **Core Layer:** Routers provide inter-VLAN routing and connectivity between different network segments.
* **Distribution Layer:** Switches manage VLANs and provide connectivity to access layer devices.
* **Access Layer:** Wired and wireless access points allow end-user devices (PCs, laptops, smartphones, tablets) to connect to the network.

The network topology includes the following:

* Multiple VLANs for departmental segmentation (e.g., Sales, HR, Finance, IT Dept, Admin Dept, Reception, Store, Logistic).
* Inter-VLAN routing to enable communication between different departments.
* Wired connectivity for desktop computers and printers.
* Wireless connectivity for laptops, smartphones, and tablets.

## IP Addressing Scheme

The network uses a combination of IPv4 addressing. The subnets are designed to efficiently allocate IP addresses to each department.

## Devices Used

* Routers (Cisco)
* Switches (Cisco)
* Access Points
* PCs
* Laptops
* Printers
* Smartphones
* Tablets

## Key Features

* VLAN segmentation for enhanced security and network management.
* Inter-VLAN routing for communication between departments.
* Wired and wireless connectivity.
* Practical application of networking concepts in a real-world scenario.
